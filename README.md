<h4>The first round of Ryan International Artificial Intelligence Competition is organized by Sharif University of
Technology.</h4>

<h4>In order to prepare the participants as much as possible to participate in the international artificial intelligence
competitions, Sharif University of Technology organizes training courses for the competitions at two preliminary and
advanced levels.</h4>

<h4>What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?</h4>
<h5>“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In the SVM algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane that differentiates the two classes very well</h5>

<h5>Support Vectors are simply the co-ordinates of individual observation. The SVM classifier is a frontier which best segregates the two classes (hyper-plane/ line).

<h4>What is Logistic Regression?</h4>

<h5>It is used to determine the value of a continuous dependent variable. 
Logistic Regression is generally used for classification purposes. Unlike `Linear Regression`, the dependent variable can take a limited number of values only i.e, the dependent variable is categorical. When the number of possible outcomes is only two it is called Binary Logistic Regression.</h5>
